Firmware retraction

    # Done steps:
    # 9) total zhop styles: standard, ramp, helix
    # 6) ramp z_hop: to do this, just don't execute vertical move but do command redefinition...
    # 2) make z_hop depending on virtual sd card being installed --> Not needed. Disable Motor and homing event work also to monitor streaming gcode
    # 3) prevent g10 to execute if not homed or if extruder temp not high enough --> both conditions implemented.

    # 1) add listening to virtual_sdcard:reset_file or polling change to printing or from printing and clear any retraction if this event happens

    # 8) test, test, test and check if quality and/or speed are improved to justify a merge --> E3D Overhang egg


    # 4) add extruder-stepper parallel moving with retract speed for a shorther move with full speed after retract is done
    # 5) get last move to calculate angle and figure out the perpendicularly located helix axis...to ensure that the helix always go 90deg away...
    # 7) Check Marlin Auto-retract to exchange slicer retraction by firmware retraction on old files
    
    # Check video of firmware retract: https://youtu.be/T4N59u4wm-Y (saying klipper doesnt support zhop as negative...good argument for a merge)
    # Check video on speed improvement of diagonal retract vs. vertical. ideally, helix takes away all stringing at no time lost
